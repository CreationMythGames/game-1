---

### Pre-Production

- Brainstorm and define our concept, genre, target audience
- Establish narrative, characters, and world.
- Set design goals.
- Create a game design document.
- Create a project plan.

### Prototype

- Create a basic prototype to test and iterate on core gameplay mechanics.
- Experiment with art, ideas, features, mechanics and refine the concept.
- Gather feedback from playtesters and iterate.

---

### Production

- Develop game assets: characters, environments, animations, sounds, etc.
- Program the game's mechanics, systems and user interface
- Implement the narratives, dialogues, quests, etc.
- Continuously playtest and iterate to ensure it meets our design goals.

---

### Playtesting and Polish

- Conduct thorough playtesting with a selected group of testers.
- Fix bugs, improve performance, and polish the game based on feedback.

An indie game can take a weekend or a decade. What's the right timeline for us?

# Advice For First Timers

---

#### Make a Small, Focused Game

We need to learn the ropes. A small-scale game can still take 3-12 months to develop.

---

#### Don't Start With Your Dream Game

Our first game should be focused on **getting something out the door** and **learning**. As beginners, we can't lament failing to do justice to our loftiest goals.

---

#### Join A Community

There are so many people that we can learn and get help from outside of our own team. There are paid and free game dev communities where we can connect with these folks.

# Our Project & Process

---

## Values

- Get It Done.
- Have Fun!
- Learn Together
- Celebrate Achievements
- Create Consistency
- Self Manage
- Ask For Help

---

### Get It Done.

Crossing the finish line is #1. An unfinished game:

- hurts a portfolio more than it helps it
- can't be sold
- isn't fun

---

### Have Fun!

Let's enjoy the creative journey and have fun along the way. Passion and enthusiasm will make a better game.

---

#### Make Learning a Priority & Get Better Together

We know that we don't know how to do this really well, yet. To get there, we should observe ourselves and each other, ask for feedback, and be as critical, constructive and creative about our process as we are about our individual crafts. Let's lift our heads out of the weeds and reflect periodically.

---

#### Celebrate Achievements and Milestones

Regularly acknowledge and celebrate progress, accomplishments, and milestones. We need to take the time to pat ourselves on the back, because who else is going to do it!

---

# üóìÔ∏è

#### Consistency From Inconsistent Schedules

This is a side project for all of us. For some of us, it's a side-side project. Let's keep a calendar of how many hours we can contribute each week.

---

#### Be Adaptable and Resilient

Things will change and challenges will arise, so we have to remain flexible and adapt plans and expectations throughout the project. Remaining optimistic takes work and we should always believe in the idea that we are making the best game we can. We should focus on finding solutions instead of dwelling on problems.

---

# üßë‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è

#### Self Managing

It's a small project we don't have a fulltime manager. Each contributor needs to keep the team up-to-date on their schedule, objectives, progress, and blockers. Take initiative and responsibility for the domain around you, there's no one else!

---

# ü§ù

#### Asking For Help

Let's foster a supportive environment where it's encouraged to ask the group for help or insight when we're stuck, confused, unsure or struggling with our responsibilities. We might have valuable insight, or might know someone who can help! Within reason: we must respect the value of everyone's time since they have busy schedules.

---

## Process

---

#### Assembling Our Team

We should all be realistic about what we can contribute, and commit to the roles that we can. As a group we should reach out to make sure we have the best team possible and have all our roles covered.

---

#### Play Games, Steal Ideas

We should research and play a lot of indie games, with a process for recording information, critique and good ideas. This will help us develop intuition for what's possible with constrained resources, and give us ideas for what we want in our game.

---

- How big is the dev team?
- How long was the dev timeline?
- Capture lots of screenshots/photos and take lots of notes
- Present a study to the team
